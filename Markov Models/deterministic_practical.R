# Add state costs

# Run the file "markov_smoking_deterministic.R" 


# Redefine the state costs
# Store in an NA array and then fill in below
state_costs<-array(dim = c(n_states), dimnames = list(state_names))

# Cost associated with 1-year in the smoking state is £100
# Divide by 2 as cycle length is 6 months
state_costs["Smoking"] <- 100 /  2

# Cost associated with 1-year in the not smoking state is 0
# Again divide by 2 as cycle length is 6 months
state_costs["Not smoking"] <- 0

# Same code as before from here on below. Look at the difference in the results and compare ICER values.

# Build an array to store the cohort vector at each cycle
