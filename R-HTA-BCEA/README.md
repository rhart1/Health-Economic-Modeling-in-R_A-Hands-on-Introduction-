# Introduction to R for Health Economics using BCEA

The slides for this lecture are available at [https://gianluca.statistica.it/slides/ispor-2022](https://gianluca.statistica.it/slides/ispor-2022/bcea). They are in `html` format --- it's just easier to access them (and make them accessible!) and, if you really would like that, you can download the [pdf version](bcea-2022.pdf). But the slides will also remain available after the workshop.
