# ISPOR short course: An intro to R modelling
 
This repository contains the materials for the ISPOR short course entitled 'Health Economic Modeling in R: A Hands-on Introduction'

We are going to be repeating this short course (in-person) at ISPOR Europe 2022 in Vienna on 6th November, taking in feedback from our virtual session.
