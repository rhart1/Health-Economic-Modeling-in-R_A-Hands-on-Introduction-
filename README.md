# ISPOR short course: An intro to R modelling
 
This repository contains the materials for the ISPOR short course entitled 'Health Economic Modeling in R: A Hands-on Introduction'

We are going to be repeating this short course (in-person) at ISPOR EU 2025 in Glasgow on 9th November, taking in feedback from our prior virtual and in-person sessions. All details can be found [here](https://www.ispor.org/conferences-education/event/2025/11/09/default-calendar/november-9----health-economic-modeling-in-r--a-hands-on-introduction---in-person-at-ispor-europe-2025).

Our course materials, as well as extensive extended reading, can also be found in our book [R for Health Technology Assessment](https://www.routledge.com/R-for-Health-Technology-Assessment/Baio-Thom-Pechlivanoglou/p/book/9780367468910?srsltid=AfmBOoqlQCE_8xvu09TIHd__5Teb-GfuQiRxZYj0T5lAn4AISQDO9DTb), which can also be accessed online [here](https://gianluca.statistica.it/books/online/r-hta/).

Hope to see you there!
