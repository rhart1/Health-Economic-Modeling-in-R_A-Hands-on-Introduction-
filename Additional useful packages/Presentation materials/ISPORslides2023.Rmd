## <br>The hesim package

`hesim` supports three types of health economic models:

(i) **Cohort discrete time state transition models (cDTSTMs)** - These are Markov cohort models and can be time-homogeneous or time-inhomogeneous

(ii) **N-state partitioned survival models (PSMs)** - Area under the curve model

(iii) **Individual-level continuous time state transition models (iCTSTMs)** - individual-level simulations that can encompass both Markov and semi-Markov processes


All models are implemented as R6 classes and have methods for simulating disease progression, QALYs, and costs.

This package is well documented in its [CRAN vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hesim/vignettes/intro.html) and [publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349424271_hesim_Health_Economic_Simulation_Modeling_and_Decision_Analysis/link/605c068192851cd8ce65e830/download)

One of the examples is recreated in the [short course GitHub repo](https://github.com/rhart1/Health-Economic-Modeling-in-R_A-Hands-on-Introduction-/blob/main/Additional%20useful%20packages/hesim%20example%20model.R) (*hesim example model.R* script in the *Additional useful packages* folder)

### <br>hesim functionalities

---
### <br>You've made a model. What's next?

--

You will now need to communicate it to a wider audience.

--

Therefore, you will need to consider the following points for your project:

--

- Who is your audience?

 - Do they know R?
 

- What outputs do you need to effectively communicate this model, and make it as transparent as possible?

  - Graphs
  - Tables
  - Intermediate calculations
  

- What documentation is required?


---
## <br>R Markdown
`rmarkdown` - a file format for making documents with R
<br><br> 
There are two examples of this in [short course GitHub repo](https://github.com/rhart1/Health-Economic-Modeling-in-R_A-Hands-on-Introduction-/tree/main/Additional%20useful%20packages/R%20Markdown%20scripts), one in html and one in pdf.

Please open the *Additional useful packages* folder and open the *R Markdown scripts* folder. There are two scripts there.

- Looking through, there are differences between a standard R script and an rmd script

  - It is text (white background) interspaced by code 'chunks' (grey background)
  - This means that you do not need to copy and paste R outputs to your report, you only need to write the report and interpret
  
--

- There is really good documentation on how you can create one

  - https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown - Online book
  - https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html - Examples
  
--

<br><br>
A default R Markdown document can be created from within RStudio (5 minute example exercise)

---
## <br>R Markdown
The examples in this project are called from the *hesim example model.R* script

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
library(rmarkdown)   # For creating markdown outputs (html and pdf)
library(bookdown)    # For creating markdown outputs (html and pdf)
library(knitr)       # For creating markdown outputs (html and pdf)
library(kableExtra)  # For creating nice-looking tables in rmarkdown

Export_params <- list(
  # Main results
  Stateprobs            = ictstm$stateprobs_,
  Summarisedf           = ce_sim_ictstm,
  labs_indiv            = labs_indiv
)

Markdown_location <- "./Additional useful packages/R Markdown scripts/"
```

---
## <br>R Markdown

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
# html document
rmarkdown::render(
  input = file.path(Markdown_location,"hesim html report.Rmd"),
  output_format = 'bookdown::html_document2',
  output_file = "./Additional useful packages/hesim-html-report.html",
  params = Export_params,
  envir = environment()
)

# pdf document
rmarkdown::render(
  input = file.path(Markdown_location,"hesim pdf report.Rmd"),
  output_format = 'bookdown::pdf_document2',
  output_file = "./Additional useful packages/hesim-pdf-report.pdf", 
  params = Export_params,
  envir = environment()
)
```

If you are unable to generate these documents at present, the generated html and pdf documents are in the *Additional useful packages* folder at the top level.

## <br>Shiny
`shiny` - a package that makes it possible to create interactive web applications from R code

Creating an R shiny app considerably increases the accessibility of your R code. However, it is a further learning curve and can be time consuming. 

At it's most basic, a shiny app usually consists of three scripts:
- app.R 
  - The application is called from this script
- server.R
  - The app functionality. This is wrapped within a function: `function(input, output, session){}` 
  - This contains the code for the app 'back-end'
- ui.R
  - This is the layout of the graphical user interface (GUI)
  - This contains the code for the app 'front-end'

<br><br>  
However, it is possible to have the server function and ui within the app.R script; this is the case in the default app if created from RStudio (5 minute example exercise)


---
### <br>Shiny reactivity

Having your R code as a shiny app enables users to interact with the R code without seeing the R code. This works by the app 'front-end' changes causing reactions in the 'back-end' calculations.

--

1. The user interacts with the input boxes defined in the `ui.R` script <br><br>

--

2. The functions which are reactive to front-end changes are wrapped in reactive functions (e.g. reactive(), observe()) in `server.R` <br><br>

--

3. The reactive functions are always 'listening' for changes - when they detect a change the function will re-run <br><br>

--

4. The re-running of the reactive functions causes a change in the output, which the user can then see <br><br>

--

An object that is reactive (created using reactive()) is a function. This means that when referring to it later in the script, the syntax changes and brackets are needed (e.g. ictstm in the standard script becomes ictstm() in the server.R script)

---
### <br>Defining shiny inputs and outputs

There are two major lists that enable communication between the front-end and back-end:

**input list**
  - These are mostly defined in the UI
  - There are many different types, depending on the type of input
  - Each has an id, which can then be used within functions to reference the input value. For example, a numeric input with an id = 'number' can be referenced in a function but using `input$number`
  - Examples of inputs can be found here: https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson3/

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE} 
#Input example:
#This is written in the ui
numericInputIcon(
  inputId = "Input_discount_Costs",
  label = "Discount for Costs:",
  min = 0,
  max = 100,
  value = 3.5,
  icon = list(NULL, icon("percent"))
)
```

---
### <br>Defining shiny inputs and outputs

**output list**
  - The results of your functions that you want to then display front-end are defined in the outputs list
  - As with inputs, there are a variety of functions that can be used depending on the type of output you want to display
  - Each has an id. The location of the output is defined in the ui, and then the output content is defined in the server

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE} 
#Output example:
#This is written in the ui
plotOutput("Results_graph")

#This is written in the server
output$Results_graph <- renderPlot({
    autoplot(ictstm()$stateprobs_, labels = labs_indiv,
             ci = FALSE) + theme_bw()
  })
```

---
### <br>app.R

Please open the *hesim shiny app* folder within the *Additional useful packages* folder. Open the *app.R* script.

If you have all the packages previously installed, you should be able to run the app either by clicking the 'Run App' button in the top right hand corner, <img src="www/Picture6.png" width="150"> or by highlighting all the text and pressing **Ctrl + Enter**

--

<br><br>
Familiarize yourself with the layout of the app. All the functionality and graphs in the *hesim example model* are presented here
<br><br>

---
### <br>Shiny app learning and further examples

There are some great tutorials for learning how to create shiny apps:


1. https://mastering-shiny.org/basic-app.html

## <br>Making shiny apps accessible

Shiny apps can be made available and deployed in a variety of ways, for example:

--

1. R Studio (or equivalent)

  - Local or online environment to view code and run app

--

2. shinyapps.io - https://www.shinyapps.io/
 
  - Online environment to deploy app publicly (free) or make available with log-in (paid), hosted on R Studio servers

--

3. R Studio Connect - https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/

  - Hosting environment software to download on privately owned server (paid subscription)
